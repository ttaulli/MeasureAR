# MeasureAR
This iOS app uses the new Augmented Reality framework called ARKit.  But there are some prerequisites.  First of all, you will need to use a device that has an A9 chip and also has the beta version of iOS 11.  Warning:  Installing the OS can damage your data and may also result in glitches/performance issues (this is common for betas).  So hereâ€™s a video that goes through the process: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QFn-Yh2Y9k

Next, you will need to install the beta version of Xcode.  You can find it here:  https://developer.apple.com/download/

As for the MeasureAR app, you will tap two positions on the screen and you will then get the distance (in terms of inches).
